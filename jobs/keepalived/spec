  Keepalived implements the Virtual Routing Resource Protocol (VRRP),
  enabling a single virtual IP (a VIP) to be managed between multiple hosts.
  This in turn allows two or more haproxy servers to present as a single,
  unified endpoint.

packages:
  - keepalived

templates:
  bin/keepalived:          bin/keepalived
  etc/keepalived.conf.tpl: etc/keepalived.conf.tpl

properties:
  id:
    default: 1
    description: |
      A numeric ID, ranging from 1 to 255 inclusively, for the VRRP router
      group.  Each instance that is configured with the same `id` will
      consider itself a member of the virtual router group, and actively
      solicit control of the VIP.

      If you run multiple deployments of this BOSH release, you will need to
      ensure that you choose unique, non-coincidental VRRP IDs.

  interface:
    default: auto
    description: |
      What Linux kernel interface to use for bringing up the VRRP VIP.

  vip:
    description: |
      An unused IPv4 address, to be used as the virtual IP address of the
      VRRP cluster.  This interface will be managed between all instances of
      this instance group, such that only one host responds to ARP requests.

  check:
    default: killall -0 haproxy
    description: |
      A command to run (possible with arguments) to determine if the local
      node is healthy enough to continue controlling the VIP.  By default,
      this checks for the existence of the `haproxy` process, since it is
      expected that this job is co-located with that one.

  ignore-interface-faults:
    default: true
    description: |
      Ignore faults on the VRRP interface.  Only disable this if you know
      what you are doing and why you are doing it.
